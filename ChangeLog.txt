Matrix ChangeLog:

03/02/2020
realized that this programm is way to complex to be done quickly and easily. And the structure of this project is BAD. 
planning on modelling and rewriting the programm.

01/26/2020
added GF4/8/9 and all prime numbers
coming: docs and other matrix reforming operations

01/25/2020
changed the structure of gaussian elimination and put some useful methods such as 
exchanging rows into basic package named "reforming" under matrix
added functions:
-matrix
  -reforming
    -rows interaction
    -row transformation
coming features: finite field with 2 elements, completing docs of all classes


01/24/2020
start of the project, building everything from scratch
including fuctions:
-field
  -rational numbers
-number test using fields
-matrix
-matrix test using fields and matrix
-gaussian elimination
